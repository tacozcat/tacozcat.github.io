			<p>I am an Austin transplant from Atlanta, Georgia. I moved to Austin about six years ago, right after graduating from Kennesaw State University with my BBA in Finance. I am currently a manager and a bartender at The Grand. Excellent customer service has always been one of my strongest assests. When I'm not contributing to other people's fun, I enjoy playing pool, going bowling, and watching questionably bad tevelvision. I am a mother to two lovely felines. The oldest, my girl, is named Taco. My little guy is named Sid. I know that I have just outed myself as a crazy cat lady, but this is called 'About Me,' so I figured I should be honest.  </p>
